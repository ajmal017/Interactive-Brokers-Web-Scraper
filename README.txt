Created during my internship at the brokerage firm Interactive Brokers.

My time spent with the brokerage consisted of working in a number of different departments ranging from Project Management to Trade & Risk.

One specific task that I was involved in was the creation of a web scaper that scanned the Hong Kong Exchange website daily looking for newly listed IPOs and returning the relevant listing documents. This system is currently live within the firm and is used regularly by employees. 

How to get the web scraper working on your own machien:
Need to change contacts.txt
Need to change path in main.py
